              With her next effort, Swift seemed to step further away from her country music roots. She released 1989 in October 2014. "Shake It Off" proved to be one of the catchiest tracks of the year, reaching the top of the pop charts, and she immediately followed with a second chart-topping single, "Blank Space." In an age of low album sales, 1989 moved more than 1.2 million copies in its first week, making Swift the first artist to top the 1 million mark in opening-week sales for three albums.

The image of a snake is a reference to when Kim Kardashian called Swift a "snake" on Twitter in 2016 after Swift denied that she granted West permission to use her name in his song "Famous."
              reputation sold 1.05 million copies in the United States over its first four days. Along with giving the artist her fourth consecutive album to surpass 1 million in sales for its opening week, that total made reputation the top-selling album of 2017. Its success continued into 2018, surpassing 2 million in sales while generating the release of seven singles. By the end of the year, reputation had been honored with Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the AMAs and Top Selling Album at the Billboard Music Awards.
